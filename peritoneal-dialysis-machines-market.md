<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peritoneal Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Type</li><li>Gravity Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peritoneal dialysis machines market encompasses two primary types: power type and gravity type. Power type machines utilize electrical pumps to control fluid flow and pressure, allowing for precise and automated dialysis processes, enhancing patient comfort and efficiency. In contrast, gravity type machines rely on the force of gravity to facilitate fluid exchange, making them simpler and more portable but potentially less efficient in managing dialysate movement. Both types cater to varying patient needs and clinical settings.</p></p>
