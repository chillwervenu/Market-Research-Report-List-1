<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Server Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The server cooling fans market primarily comprises two types: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan's axis, providing efficient airflow and low noise levels, making them suitable for dense server environments. In contrast, centrifugal fans generate airflow perpendicular to their axis by spinning air in a circular motion, offering higher pressure and airflow for cooling larger spaces. Both types are essential for maintaining optimal operating temperatures in server systems to ensure reliability and performance.</p></p>
